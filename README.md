## Design

A three column design showing diffrent subscription plans with the advantages they are bringing along is put together in an unorderd list under three diffrent "div" tags having class name 'price-col' so that it became easy to apply the styles to all three columns altogether.

Background is a combination of two solid colors put in a linear gradient with an angle of 45degree.

A glowing Effect is added on the titles of plans  with a Hover effect collectively  so that every price column card pops out when cursor hovers over it.

A button for "Add to cart" is added under each plan with a hover effect which also turns transparent.
