# Pricing Landing Page 

 A basic Pricing Landing Page made with "HTML" and "CSS" which is responsive to the screen dimension of the device.
 



## Design

A three column design showing diffrent subscription plans with the advantages they are bringing along is put together in an unorderd list using HTML.

A button for "Add to cart" is added under each plan with a hover effect using transition in CSS.
## Challenges

I was unable to change the solid background to an external image of my choice.
